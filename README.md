# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning


It appears that you've provided a dataset with several columns, with "id" and "diagnosis" being the first two columns. The remaining columns seem to contain various numerical features related to cancer diagnosis. Here's a breakdown of the columns you've provided:

id: This column seems to be a unique identifier for each data point. It might not be relevant for the machine learning model unless you plan to use it for tracking or record-keeping purposes.

diagnosis: This column likely contains the target variable you want to predict. It appears to be related to cancer diagnosis and may have two possible values (e.g., "M" for malignant and "B" for benign).

The remaining columns seem to be numerical features that could be used as input for your machine learning model. These features describe various characteristics of cancer cells. Here's a brief description of these features:

radius_mean: The mean of the radius of the cancer cell.

texture_mean: The mean of the texture of the cancer cell.

perimeter_mean: The mean of the perimeter of the cancer cell.

area_mean: The mean of the area of the cancer cell.

smoothness_mean: The mean of smoothness of the cancer cell.

compactness_mean: The mean of compactness of the cancer cell.

concavity_mean: The mean of concavity of the cancer cell.

concave points_mean: The mean of the number of concave portions of the cancer cell.

symmetry_mean: The mean of symmetry of the cancer cell.

fractal_dimension_mean: The mean of the fractal dimension of the cancer cell.

radius_se: The standard error of the radius of the cancer cell.

texture_se: The standard error of the texture of the cancer cell.

perimeter_se: The standard error of the perimeter of the cancer cell.

area_se: The standard error of the area of the cancer cell.

smoothness_se: The standard error of smoothness of the cancer cell.

compactness_se: The standard error of compactness of the cancer cell.

concavity_se: The standard error of concavity of the cancer cell.

concave points_se: The standard error of the number of concave portions of the cancer cell.

symmetry_se: The standard error of symmetry of the cancer cell.

fractal_dimension_se: The standard error of the fractal dimension of the cancer cell.

radius_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of the radius of the cancer cell.

texture_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of the texture of the cancer cell.

perimeter_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of the perimeter of the cancer cell.

area_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of the area of the cancer cell.

smoothness_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of smoothness of the cancer cell.

compactness_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of compactness of the cancer cell.

concavity_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of concavity of the cancer cell.

concave points_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of the number of concave portions of the cancer cell.

symmetry_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of symmetry of the cancer cell.

fractal_dimension_worst: The "worst" or largest mean value of the fractal dimension of the cancer cell.

With this dataset, you can build a machine learning model to predict the "diagnosis"
